# Neural-Networks
This repository will contain some simple implementations of neural networks using TensorFlow

## Stock Prediction ##
The stock price prediction project was inspired by this article: https://www.section.io/engineering-education/stock-price-prediction-using-python/. I have adjusted the network and have also added a future stock price prediction functionality. The neural network feeds its own generated data to predict future prices. I have used NKE stocks for training and testing.

## Image recognition ##
This notebook uses the cifar 10 dataset to train a convolutional network which is able to recognise images of certain objects. More information about the dataset can be found here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html .
